    <p> What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>

  <a id = "MiamiHeat"> The decision </a>

<p> James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010.[83] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[84] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[85] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[86] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[87] reports later arose that the trio had discussed their upcoming 2010 free agencies among themselves back in 2006.[88] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[89] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[90] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[89] </p>
